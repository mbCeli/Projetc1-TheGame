THERE IS
- A board
- 3 x 3 holes on the board
- One player
- 5 moles
- A countdown

IDEA
- The moles are moving around de board with a mallet each.
Their objective is to smash the head of the player if they 
see his head out of any of the holes on the board. 

- The longer the head of the player is outside the hole without 
being hit the more points he will accummulate. The player loses 
if he receives 3 hits. The player wins if he has received less
than 3 hits by time the countdown finishes.

THE DYNAMICS
- The moles moves randomly around the board.
- When the player's head is outside the hole, the moles run to get
the player. If any of the moles reaches next to the hole where
the player is before the player hides, the mole smashes the player.
The player loses one life and the moles random movement restarts.
- The user has to select with the arrow keys in what hole he 
wants to appear and press the space bar to appear out of the hole 
and press the bar again when he wants to hide. 
O 
- The hole in which the player appear is ramdonly selected and the
user only has to press the space bar to make the place hide and
a new hole will be selected.
